# Contributing
I'm happy you're ready to contribute to this project!

You can contribute in the following ways:
- Create an issue for a bug. I will review that and try to fix it, if I consider it important. Keep in mind that the next contribution method is preferred.
- Create an issue for a bug, with a link to a pull request fixing it. This is preferred for bugs, as the fix will be immediately available after testing.
- Create an issue for a feature. If you have noticed that the code is lacking a feature that the original project has, please open an issue for it to be implemented. If you have some code for it, see the next option
- Create an issue for a feature, with a link to a pull request adding the feature. This is preferred.
